Markdone is a specification for the format and organization of checklist files for the purpose of personal organization and project planning.

## Acknowledgments

- [GitHub Flavored Markdown (GFM)](https://github.github.com/gfm/) - Markdone uses a subset of this specification, Markdone will validate to GFM but not all GFM will validate to Markdone.
- [Todo.txt](http://todotxt.org/) - Markdone borrows a lot from Todo.txt, however we do break or modify formating rules. Even #1!
- [Getting Things Done (GTD)](https://gettingthingsdone.com/) - Markdone is designed to facilitate the implementation of a GTD system.

## Mission

To combine the human readable styling of Markdown with the machine readable concepts of Todo.txt.
